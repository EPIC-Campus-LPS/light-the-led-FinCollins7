What is the purpose of breadboard?
it is there so the user can connect attatchments like lights or sensors to be controlled via your pi

Does the LED orientation matter (cathode & abode)?
Yes, because the flow of electrons is one way, they can't go bacwards up the cathode to the light

Why do you put a resistor in your circuit?
So a voltage doesn't exceed the limit for whatever attachment is being used, and so it doesn't explode or overheat or damae anything

How will a resistor with greater resistance affect the light?
The higher the resistamce, the dimmer the light because there is less voltage going to the light and that will result in a lower ligth output
